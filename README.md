# boreutils

GNU coreutils, rewritten in pure [wolf](https://github.com/wolffe-lang/wolf-lang),
one program at a time.

Each utility aims to be a drop-in replacement for the behaviour that
users and scripts rely on. Where wolf allows it, each also aims to be
faster than GNU. Speed is measured per utility and never promised.
GNU's `cat` and `wc` are already fast, so beating them counts as a
finding, not as a requirement.

## Why

- **A second large production wolf codebase, after
  [lobo](https://github.com/wolffe-lang/lobo).** The project is dozens
  of small, complete programs, each with one job. That makes it a good
  shape of wolf to learn from, whether you are a reader, a new
  contributor or a model.
- **Pressure on the OS and IO surface.** Coreutils need argv, exit
  codes, streaming byte IO on stdin, stdout and files, SIGPIPE,
  permissions, users and time. When a utility hits a gap in wolf, the
  gap is filed upstream with a witness.
- **Verifier-backed data.** GNU coreutils is the behavioural oracle.
  Every boreutils program is differential-tested against it.

## The licence rule

boreutils is **GPL-3.0-or-later** (see `LICENSE`).

**GNU coreutils source is never read, copied or translated here.** It
is GPL-3.0 and owned by the FSF, so a translation of it would be a
derivative that this project does not wholly own. Each utility is
written from these sources only:

- the POSIX.1-2024 utility specification;
- GNU's documented behaviour: `--help`, the info manual's option
  descriptions, and black-box runs of the GNU binary;
- the permissively licensed implementations, as design references
  only: [uutils/coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) (MIT)
  and [toybox](https://landley.net/toybox/) (0BSD).

The header of each utility records which of these references were
consulted.
